`Email me <daniele@vurt.org>`_. I enjoy hearing about other people's experiences with Diátaxis and read everything I receive. 

I appreciate all the interest and do my best to reply, but I get a considerable quantity of email related to Diátaxis and I can't promise to respond to every message.

If you'd like to discuss Diátaxis with other users, please see the *#diataxis* channel on the
`Write the Docs Slack group <https://www.writethedocs.org/slack/>`_, or the `Discussions

repository for this website <https://github.com/evildmp/diataxis-documentation-framework>`_.


Origins and development
-----------------------

You can find `an earlier presentation of some of these ideas <https://documentation.divio.com>`_, that I created while working at Divio between 2014-2021. I still agree with most of it, though there are several aspects that I now think I got wrong.

The original context for the Diátaxis approach was limited to software product documentation. 

In 2021 I was awarded a Fellowship of the `Software Sustainability Institute <http://software.ac.uk/blog/sorry-state-usable-software-open-science-results-open-science-retreat>`_, to explore its application in scientific research contexts. More recently I've explored its application in internal corporate documentation, organisational management and education, and also its application at scale. This work is on-going.

Other people have corresponded with me to share their experience of applying Diátaxis to note-taking systems and even as part of a systematic approach to household management.
