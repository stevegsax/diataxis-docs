Applying Diátaxis
=================


The pages in this section are concerned with putting Diátaxis into practice. 

..  sidebar:: 
    
    Diátaxis is underpinned by :doc:`systematic theoretical principles <theory>`, but understanding them is not necessary to make effective use of the system. 

Diátaxis is primarily intended as a pragmatic approach for people working on documentation. Most of the key principles required to put it into practice successfully can be grasped intuitively. 

Don't wait to understand Diátaxis before you start trying to put it into practice. Not only do you not need to understand it all to make use of it, you will not understand it until you have started using it (this itself is a Diátaxis principle).  

As soon as you feel you have picked up an idea that seems worth applying to your work, try applying it. Come back here when you need more clarity or reassurance. Iterate between your work and reflecting on your work.

At the core of Diátaxis are the four different kinds of documentation it identifies. If you're encountering Diátaxis for the first time, start with these pages. 

* :doc:`tutorials` - learning-oriented experiences
* :doc:`how-to-guides` - goal-oriented directions
* :doc:`reference` - information-oriented technical description
* :doc:`explanation` - understanding-oriented discussion 

Diátaxis prescribes principles that guide action. These translate into particular ways of working, with implications for documentation process and execution. Once you've made your first start, the tools and methods outlined here will help smooth your way.

* :doc:`compass` - a simple tool for direction-finding
* :doc:`Workflow <how-to-use-diataxis>` in Diátaxis
