# Generate User Documentation Using Diataxis Principles

The purpose of this project is to develop tools and methodologies that allow
us to automatically generate a set of user documentation that follows the
principles of the 
[Diataxis](https://github.com/evildmp/diataxis-documentation-framework.git) 
project.

- A copy of the original Diataxis project documentation is stored in subdirectory 
`diataxis-documentation-framework/`. 
- A summary of the Diataxis principles is in [specs/design.md](specs/design.md)`.
