# Make A Diataxis Tutorial

This file contains a series of steps that should be followed when creating or updating a tutorial following the Diataxis principles.

## Steps

### TODO: Create a Diátaxis Tutorial

Use this checklist when designing a new tutorial so that it follows the Diátaxis principles. Each task is an action to complete or verify.

1. **Clarify the learner and goal**
    - Decide what basic competence the tutorial should deliver and who the learner is
    - Pick a small, meaningful project the learner can finish

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Identify the target audience for this tutorial and list any assumed prerequisites."
    - "Describe the specific competence the learner will gain by completing the tutorial."
    - "Suggest a concise project that demonstrates this competence."
2. **Show the destination first**
    - Briefly state what will be built so the learner sees the goal right away

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Write a single sentence summarizing the finished project so learners know the goal."

3. **Prepare a safe starting point**
    - Provide prerequisites or starter files
    - Ensure every step is repeatable without harm if something goes wrong

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "List any software or tools the learner must install before starting."
    - "Outline how to obtain starter files or a baseline environment."
    - "Explain how to recover if a step fails so the learner can try again."
4. **Write concrete, numbered steps**
    - Use the first‑person plural voice ("we")
    - Give a clear action and show expected output
    - Keep a running narrative of what the learner should observe

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Draft numbered steps describing each action in first-person plural."
    - "For each step, provide the command or action and the expected output." 
    - "Include a short sentence describing what the learner should notice after each step." 
5. **Deliver results early and often**
    - Each action should produce a visible change or output
    - Encourage the learner to repeat a step to build confidence

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Explain the first small success the learner should see after the initial step." 
    - "Suggest moments where repeating an action helps reinforce understanding." 
6. **Keep explanation to a minimum**
    - Link to separate explanation pages when needed
    - Do not teach theory inside the tutorial

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Provide links to reference or explanation documents for deeper theory." 
    - "Rewrite the instructions so that only essential context appears in the tutorial." 
7. **Ignore alternatives and options**
    - Focus solely on the path that reaches the stated goal

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Eliminate any optional steps or branching instructions." 
    - "Present a single clear path that accomplishes the stated goal." 
8. **Test for perfect reliability**
    - Run through the tutorial yourself and fix anything that might fail
    - Have someone else test it and note any confusion

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Simulate running each step to verify commands and output." 
    - "Identify spots where a learner might be confused and clarify them." 
9. **Provide a conclusion and next steps**
    - Summarize what the learner accomplished
    - Point to related how‑to guides or reference material for further work

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Write a short summary of the finished project." 
    - "Recommend follow‑up how‑to guides or reference sections for additional learning." 
10. **Iterate in small improvements**
    - Use feedback to refine wording and steps
    - Publish changes frequently rather than waiting for large revisions

    #### Example LLM prompts

    - "Gather user feedback on the tutorial and list specific improvements." 
    - "Plan incremental updates instead of a large rewrite."
