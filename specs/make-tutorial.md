# Make A Diataxis Tutorial

This file contains a series of steps that should be followed when creating or updating a tutorial following the Diataxis principles.

## Steps

### TODO: Create a Diátaxis Tutorial

Use this checklist when designing a new tutorial so that it follows the Diátaxis principles. Each task is an action to complete or verify.

1. **Clarify the learner and goal**
   - Decide what basic competence the tutorial should deliver and who the learner is
   - Pick a small, meaningful project the learner can finish
2. **Show the destination first**
   - Briefly state what will be built so the learner sees the goal right away
3. **Prepare a safe starting point**
   - Provide prerequisites or starter files
   - Ensure every step is repeatable without harm if something goes wrong
4. **Write concrete, numbered steps**
   - Use the first‑person plural voice ("we")
   - Give a clear action and show expected output
   - Keep a running narrative of what the learner should observe
5. **Deliver results early and often**
   - Each action should produce a visible change or output
   - Encourage the learner to repeat a step to build confidence
6. **Keep explanation to a minimum**
   - Link to separate explanation pages when needed
   - Do not teach theory inside the tutorial
7. **Ignore alternatives and options**
   - Focus solely on the path that reaches the stated goal
8. **Test for perfect reliability**
   - Run through the tutorial yourself and fix anything that might fail
   - Have someone else test it and note any confusion
9. **Provide a conclusion and next steps**
   - Summarize what the learner accomplished
   - Point to related how‑to guides or reference material for further work
10. **Iterate in small improvements**
    - Use feedback to refine wording and steps
    - Publish changes frequently rather than waiting for large revisions
